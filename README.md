# Arduino--Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
- Arduino Portenta H7
- Breast Cancer Classification.ipynb: trains the model, extracts the model parameters, prepares the test dataset for the Arduino, and benchmarks the classification performance on the Arduino
- Breast_Cancer_Classification.ino: implements computations optimized by using the logarithmic domain and performs the classification on the Arduino
